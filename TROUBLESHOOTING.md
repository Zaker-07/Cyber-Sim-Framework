This document provides solutions to common issues that may arise while setting up or using the CyberSim Framework.

## 1. Permission Denied Errors

### **Problem**
When running commands or accessing configuration files, you encounter a "Permission Denied" error.

### **Solution**
Run the command with `sudo`:
bash
sudo <command>
Ensure you have the necessary permissions to access the required files and directories.

2. Snort Configuration Errors
Problem
Error messages such as:

vbnet
ERROR: can't load /etc/snort/snort.conf: unexpected symbol near '#'
Solution
Ensure that there are no commented or malformed lines in the snort.conf file.
Check the following lines:
plaintext
ipvar HOME_NET 192.168.1.0/24
Ensure the network address format is correct.
3. Python Module Errors (Flask, Pandas, etc.)
Problem

Solution
Activate your virtual environment:
bash

source venv/bin/activate
Install the required dependencies:
bash

pip3 install -r requirements.txt
4. Virtual Environment Creation Errors

Start and enable the Docker service:
bash

sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
6. Snort Alerts Not Showing
Problem
The Snort monitoring script does not show any alerts, even when an attack simulation is performed.

Solution
Verify that Snort is configured correctly with rules.
Check if the correct network interface is being used:
bash

sudo snort -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -i eth0 -A fast
Ensure traffic is being captured on the specified interface.
7. Dashboard Not Loading

Check if the Flask app is running:
bash

python3 dashboard.py
Ensure port 8080 is not occupied by another process.
8. Contribution Issues
